Logo for the library.

- The logo has the circle centered, so on the left side, the logo is almost at the edge of the image, but on the right side, there is some space between the logo and the edge of the image. This is commonly used as it looks better graphically.

- When it is necessary to have no empty spaces and for the logo to occupy the entire size of the image, use logo_trim.svg.

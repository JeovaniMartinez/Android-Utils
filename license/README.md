# License Terms & Privacy Policy

- The content of license-terms_privacy-policy folder must be that of the file resources > license-terms_privacy-policy > license-terms_privacy-policy_template.rar of the master branch of the project.
- The content is placed in the license-terms_privacy-policy folder so that the build keeps the links to the terms and privacy policy prefixed with /license-terms_privacy-policy.

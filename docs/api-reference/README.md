## Android Utils API Reference

Notes:
- The documentation are generated by Dokka from the androidutils module and is published in gh-pages branch.
- Test docs in a web server, do not open directly html files in browser, as it may not display correctly.
- This folder contains only a backup from the documentation, and the file is stored in RAR format to prevent that GitHub include the files in the languages statistics.

Steps to generate the API reference documentation:
- Execute dokkaHtml task in androidutils > documentation task of Gradle.
- Add the generated folder into new RAR file named api-reference[library-version].rar
- Add RAR file to the repository and delete the old documentation file.
